@body

There are many ways to contribute to CanJS, whether you’re a developer who wants to code, a designer who can help improve the design and usability of our projects, or someone who’s interested in helping other members of the community.

## Finding open issues

CanJS uses [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/canjs/canjs/issues) to track improvements we want to make to the project, whether that’s bug fixes, new features, design improvements, etc.

We use a few labels to organize issues across all of the repositories:

- “help wanted” for any issues with which the core team would like help
- “easy” for issues the core team thinks are good for someone who’s new to contributing
- “documentation” for issues related to documenting the APIs
- “design” for issues that could use a designer’s expertise

Here are links to GitHub searches for those terms:

- CanJS
	- [design](https://github.com/search?q=org%3Acanjs+label%3Adesign&state=open)
	- [documentation](https://github.com/search?q=org%3Acanjs+label%3Adesign&state=open)
	- [easy](https://github.com/search?q=org%3Acanjs+label%3Aeasy&state=open)
	- [help wanted](https://github.com/search?q=org%3Acanjs+label%3A%22help+wanted%22&state=open)

Triaging issues that have no labels is also really helpful! Here are some searches you can use to find unlabeled issues:

## Spreading the word

We also always need help spreading the word about the CanJS projects. Check out the [evangelism section](#evangelism) on how you can [write a blog post](#writing-a-blog-article), [speak at a conference](#speaking-at-a-conference-or-meetup), or [organize a meetup](#organizing-a-donejs-meetup).
