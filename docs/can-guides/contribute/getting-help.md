@description Get help with your CanJS questions!

@body

[Our forums](http://forums.donejs.com/c/canjs) and [Gitter chat](https://gitter.im/canjs/canjs) are the best places to ask questions. The core team regularly checks both and there are other users who generously help others.

If you’re interested in contributing to CanJS, the core team is happy to pair with you to fix a bug or write a new feature! Please either message us on Gitter or the forums, or leave a comment on the GitHub issue you’re interested in helping with. We will happily walk you through setting up your development environment, creating a test and/or writing documentation, and submitting a pull request.
